# Neural network simple implementation
Native implementation of neural network in Python.

## Objective
_You learn when you actually see something working_. This repository contains source code of simple neural networks. The main focus is to help us understand the mechanics behind Artificial Neural Network's (ANN) training mechanism.

Using 3rd party library is avoided as much as possible. Some models may require ones such as Numpy, though.

## Execution
*nn2.py* can execute standalone.

e.g.
```
python3 src/nn2.py
```
